## Introduction

**ZWP** (or Zastrozzi Web Platform) is a next generation web application framework built upon Angular’s foundations. It is built in modern Typescript and is built as a monorepo using **@nrwl/nx**. 

**ZWP** is designed for creating browser applications, browser plugins, widgets, and progressive web apps.
